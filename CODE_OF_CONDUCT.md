# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

As the sole developer of karman, I pledge to make participation in this project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

I pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by mistakes, and learning from the experience.
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

As the project maintainer, I am responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that I deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

I have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. I will also work to ensure that the community is a safe and respectful environment for everyone.

## Reporting

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting me at [surtecha@gmail.com]. All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Confidentiality will be maintained with regard to the reporter of an incident.
